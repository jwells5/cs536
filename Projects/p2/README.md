# Project 2

> For this assignment you will use JLex to write a scanner for our language, called moo, a small subset of the C++ language. Features of moo that are relevant to this assignment are described below. You will also write a main program (P2.java) to test your scanner. You will be graded both on the correctness of your scanner and on how thoroughly your main program tests the scanner.

## Notes

Missed a token and failed to report bad escape character.
